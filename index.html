            <p>Welcome all to MY TAILOR.<br>
                When you picture a backpacker in your head, do you think of someone
                dressed top to toe in tailor-made threads, or somebody in hippie pants, flip-flops, and a vest
                that has stains for days.
                <br>Probably the latter, right? But it doesn’t have to be that way.
                When you take your order through us,
                it’s a great feeling to know that your money will buy you so many more great and cheap clothes.
                <br>But that’s not the only thing it can buy.
                There are places all over the world that are hubs for cheap, high quality tailoring.
                <br>Whether you want to invest in a sharp suit for when you return home after a gap year,
                a dress that you can picture in your head but can’t find on the rack, or simply some hippie pants
                that fit better, try out these destinations for size.</p>
